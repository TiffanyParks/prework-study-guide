# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Importance of Prework
Because of the challenging nature of this program, we want you to come ready to sprint on day one. To help prepare you, we've created these modules to be completed before your first day. The prework will provide you with the preliminary skills and information you need to begin the course. It will also give you a glimpse of what's to come.


## Installation

We recommend reading the sections in sequential order, as each section builds on the previous one. You should also complete all assignments, some of which will be fairly challenging and require outside research.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
